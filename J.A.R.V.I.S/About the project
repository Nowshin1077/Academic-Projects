Project Name: Virtual Personal Assistant - JARVIS
A small discription about the project:

●  It's a simple system build with Python.

●  As a personal assistant, Jarvis assists the end-user with day-to-day activities like general human conversation, searching queries in various 
   search engines like Google, Bing or Yahoo, Searching for videos, etc.

●  Through command, the user can do a search or note when he/she is busy with other things. This system can be quite useful for physically disabled 
   or sick people because by their single command they can some day-to-day activities like voice interaction, music playback, making notes, setting 
   alarms, providing weather condition and other real-time information, such as news.

Used Packages
-----------------
The following Modules or packages we used in our project:
● Pyttsx 3
Pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
Basically, it provides an engine that will convert our text to speech.

● Speech Recognition
Speech Recognition is an important feature in several applications used such as home automation, artificial intelligence, etc. 
It’s a library that supports several engines and APIs, online and offline.

● PyAudio
It is required only if we need to use microphone input.

● Date Time
The date-time module supplies classes for manipulating dates & times in both simple and complex ways.

● Wikipedia
Wikipedia is a python library that makes it easy to access and parse data from Wikipedia. It
wraps the Media Wiki API so that the user can focus on using Wikipedia data, not getting it.

● Wheel package
Wheels are a component of the Python ecosystem that helps to make package installs just
work. They allow for faster installations and more stability in the package distribution process.

● os
The main purpose of the OS module is to interact with our operating system. The primary use
for it is to create folders, remove folders, move folders, and sometimes change the working directory.

● PyAutoGUI
PyAutoGUI is a cross-platform GUI automation Python module for human beings. Used to
programmatically control the mouse & keyboard.

● psutil
psutil (process and system utilities) is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on
running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python.
It is useful mainly for system monitoring, profiling and limiting process resources and
management of running processes.
We used this to know the battery percentage of the laptop.

● speedtest-cli (for internet speed)
This will measure the host internet speed.It uses boto3 under the hood, so it config files to be
present in the user's home directory.

● pywikihow (for wiki how)
Simple Decorator to measure a function execution time.

● Webbrowser
This is a dummy implementation of a module for the standard library of Pycopy project

● sys
This package is an ongoing development from Andreas Evensen, a student at Lund
University. Packages contain numerical-analysis tools that were used through the bachelor
program of physics, at mentioned University. Mainly the Analysis-tools are simple but
effective, some use brute force to compute.

● pyjokes
Pyjokes is a python library that is used to create one-line jokes for users.

● requests
Requests is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library.
